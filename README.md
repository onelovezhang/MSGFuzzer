Due to requirements from industrial robot manufacturers, we cannot publish crash details until the vulnerability is fixed. After negotiation, we provided one of the crash data, see ~/boofuzz-result/crash8.

We will publish the specific vulnerability details on GitHub with the permission of the manufacturer.
