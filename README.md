# README

Due to requirements from industrial robot manufacturers, we cannot publish crash details until the vulnerability is fixed. 

After negotiation, we provided one of the crash reproduction examples, see test_crash.py.

We will publish the specific vulnerability details on GitHub with the permission of the manufacturer.
