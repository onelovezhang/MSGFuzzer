# README

Due to requirements from industrial robot manufacturers, we cannot publish crash details until the vulnerability is fixed. 

After negotiation, we provided one of the crash reproduction examples, see test_crash.py.

In addition, due to software copyright application requirements, some core codes are temporarily inconvenient to be disclosed. We will make the code public after completing the software copyright application.

We will publish the specific vulnerability details on GitHub with the permission of the manufacturer.
